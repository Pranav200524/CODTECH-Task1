## OVERVIEW OF THE PROJECT

### Project: Computer Vision Task: Image Classification Using TensorFlow

### Objective
The main goal is to develop a deep learning model that can accurately classify images into predefined categories or labels using TensorFlow 

###Key Activities
-**Data Cleaning **: Ensuring the data is free from anyincosistencies and missing values.
-**Image Resizing**: Resize images to a uniform size suitable for input into the neural network model.
-**Normalization **: Normalize pixel values to a common scale (e.g., [0, 1] or [-1, 1]).
-**Data Augmentation **: Augment the dataset by applying transformations like rotation, flipping, cropping, and zooming. This helps in improving the model's robustness and generalization.

###Technologies Used
-**TensorFlow **: Deep learning framework used for building, training, and deploying the model.
-**Keras **: High-level API that simplifies the construction of neural networks in TensorFlow.
-**Python  **: Programming language commonly used for machine learning tasks.
-**GPU **: Accelerates training speed, especially for large datasets and complex models.
