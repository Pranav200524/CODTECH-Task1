## OVERVIEW OF THE PROJECT

### Project: Image Classification Using TensorFlow

### Objective
The main goal is to develop a deep learning model that can accurately classify images into predefined categories or labels using TensorFlow.      

        
### Key Activities

   -**Data Cleaning**: Ensuring the data is free from anyincosistencies and missing values.
   
   -**Image Resizing**: Resize images to a uniform size suitable for input into the neural network model.
   
   -**Normalization**: Normalize pixel values to a common scale (e.g., [0, 1] or [-1, 1]).
   
   -**Data Augmentation**: Augment the dataset by applying transformations like rotation, flipping, cropping, and zooming. This helps in improving the model's robustness and 
        generalization.

### Technologies Used

-**TensorFlow**: Deep learning framework used for building, training, and deploying the model.

-**Keras**: High-level API that simplifies the construction of neural networks in TensorFlow.

-**Python**: Programming language commonly used for machine learning tasks.

-**GPU**: Accelerates training speed, especially for large datasets and complex models.

### Key Insights

-**Data Exploration**: Gain insights into the characteristics of the dataset through exploratory data analysis (EDA).

-**Domain Knowledge**: Understand the context in which the images are being classified. This helps in selecting appropriate preprocessing techniques and model architectures.

-**Learning Rate and Batch Size**: These hyperparameters significantly affect training dynamics and convergence speed. Tuning them can lead to improved model performance.

-**ROC Curve and AUC**: Relevant for binary classification tasks, provide insight into the trade-off between true positive rate and false positive rate.
